Project Overview:
The Expense Tracker allows users to manage their daily expenses based on their income. 
Users can input their income, specify various expense categories, and record the amount spent in each category. 
The application calculates and displays the remaining budget for each category and notifies the user if they exceed the allocated budget for any category.

Key Features:
- Income Input: Users can enter their income, which serves as the basis for budget allocation.
- Expense Tracking: Users can input various expense categories such as housing, insurance, food, savings, transportation, utilities, entertainment, personal, and clothing.
- Budget Calculation: The application calculates the budget allocation for each category based on the user's income.
- Expense Validation: If the user tries to spend more than the allocated budget for a category, the application notifies them with an error message.
- Dynamic Budget Adjustment: Users can add additional income, and the application dynamically adjusts the budget allocation for each category accordingly.

Expected Outcomes:
- Improved Financial Management: Users can gain better insights into their spending habits and manage their finances more effectively by tracking expenses across different categories.
- Budget Awareness: The application increases awareness of budget allocation by displaying remaining budgets for each category, helping users make informed spending decisions.
- User-Friendly Interface: With a simple and intuitive user interface, users can easily input income, expenses, and additional income, making the process of expense tracking straightforward and efficient.
- Error Handling: The application provides error messages to notify users when they exceed the allocated budget for a specific category, encouraging responsible spending behavior.

Overall, the Expense Tracker project aims to empower users to take control of their finances, track their spending, and make informed decisions to achieve their financial goals.
